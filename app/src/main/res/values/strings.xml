        <b>How to Play</b> \n
<p>To play the game, one of the participants
will have to demonstrate basic musical skills.</p>

<p>The game is designed to work alone or in a
clinical setting. When working with a client,
the therapist should allow them the
autonomy to choose any card to begin with,
and engage in the songwriting process along
the way.</p>

<b>To begin:</b> Separate the cards into the
following groups according to the label on
the front of each card: \n
Theme, Melody, Lyric, Instruments &amp;
Chord Progression]]></string>

    <string name="page2_instruction"><![CDATA[
        <b>Procedure</b> \n
<p>Pick any card to start the songwriting
process. After implementing the rules
presented on that card, you may pick another
card to continue the process.</p>

<p>The song is complete once you include all
five songwriting elements within your cards.
If you feel the need to continue your song
with more sections (a bridge, a new verse,
chorus), simply continue drawing cards to
inspire you along your creative process.</p>
<b>Note:</b> Feel free to develop your song beyond
the cards that are presented to you, these are
just starting points.]]>

    <string name="page3_instruction"><![CDATA[
        <b>About The Cards</b>\n
<p><b>Theme:</b> This will typically be the starting
point in the songwriting process to set up the
mood and theme for the song. However, if
you already have a theme in mind, you may
skip them.</p>
<p><b>Lyric:</b> Follow the directions on each card.</p>
<p><b>Chord Progression:</b> Follow the chord
progression presented on each card.</p>
<b>As a variation:</b> You may also choose two
cards: one card will address the chord
progression of the verse, while the other
card may be used as the chord progression
of the chorus.]]>
    </string>
    <string name="page4_instruction"><![CDATA[
<p><b>Instruments:</b> Play the instrument presented
on the card while singing your song.</p>
    <b>Variations:</b>
<p>1) You may add that instrument as an
embellishment throughout the song.</p>
<p>2) You may choose two cards, one
instrument to be played during the
verse, and the other during the chorus.</p>
<b>Melody:</b> Follow the directions on each card
on how to come up and develop a motive
<b>Keep in mind:</b> Each card guides you
through developing only the first 4
measures, you may draw total of 3 cards
to create a complete 12 measure verse or
course.\n
<b>Note:</b> Eventually, you will have to adjust the
melody to the chord progression and the key
of the song.]]>
